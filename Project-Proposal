Under New Management invites audiences to imagine themselves in a near-future in which Chicagoâ€™s public education system has been entirely privatized (in accordance to the pace set by the policies of our current mayor). The project subverts familiar signage, such as school marquees, building plaques, construction signs, and advertising to raise questions about the short- and long-term impact of privatization. It is a plea to the residents of this city to not give in to apathy and allow members of public office to sell off our taxpayer-financed public institutions and services to the highest bidder. As doubt and apathy spreads about the ability of individual to impact government function, we aim to enlist participants. We want you to remember that there are things about Chicago worth holding onto. The timeline and the implementation methods of this project largely revolve around distributing information in advance of the Mayoral and Aldermanic primaries that occur on February 26th, 2019. 
Building on the success of the propeller-funded lavender menace occupation project, we hope to employ similar public engagement and distribution methods, i.e. public appearances at art events in order to distribute print materials and have conversations around the issues addressed in the art objects. 
Utilizing various printing techniques including letterpress, offset and relief print methods, and laser cut stencils in order to disseminate copies far and wide at various sites, while  also utilizing the efforts of an enlisted public/participants. Using print methods formally invented for the purpose of public messaging and mass communication, we hope to be able to produce a large scale work that will largely be installed and disseminated by a willing network of participants, much like the variety of  public spaces in which lavender menace posters now live. The signs will be installed throughout the city in public places where informational signage would normally be found, including the bulletin boards of private educational institutions.
Following the installation, the collaborators will create, print, and distribute a zine that documents and describes the project at diverse public spaces including, but not limited to bars, hair salons, health clinics, libraries and local booksellers. 

**Timeline**
In the event that funds are awarded to our project, we would immediately begin selecting public signage for subversion/manipulation,  scouting prominent locations for install, and approaching local art spaces to host information sessions about the project during October and November. By the time the checks are cut in January, we will have sourced all of the necessary materials and have readied the project to begin production of the print objects/toolkits. By late January through February 26th, we will focus on installing and distributing the works into the public sphere. In March we will catalogue and document the campaign from start to finish and begin the zine layout. We would hope to have the zine object completed by April and would begin approaching business owners about stocking our publication, as well as  seek out like minded events to distribute copies at, as May begins a large season of Chicago outdoor events and festivals.

**Relevance to Contemporary Visual Arts**
This work falls into the realm of social practice. While employing well designed aestheticised art objects as a means of public messaging, mass communication and reclaiming public space, the hope is to use art as a form of conversation, consciousness raising and participation in order to save our city. I am confident in my ability to make objects of desire that participants will want to erect in diverse publics. The project with strengthen collaboration between various art collectives, individual artists, and independent businesses!

**Intended Audience**
Our audience is the residential population of the City of Chicago. Our ideal participant is anyone who feels addressed by our message and excited by the idea of installing and distributing our objects in order to be part of something larger than themselves. This includes, but is not limited to those who are politically engaged, potential voters, and neighbors.

**Desired Impact**
Under New Management poses the question of what effect privatization has on vital public services. Through interaction with the installation and zine, audiences will (1) become more aware of the privatization of public services as a current issue, (2) think critically about the impact of privatization, and (3) carry that awareness with them into their personal and political lives. The real dream would be having enough impact to alter the political landscape of our city, and to build the language for describing the consequences of having similarly bad faith actors in positions of power.
